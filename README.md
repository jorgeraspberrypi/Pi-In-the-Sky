#Pi in the Sky 

This is where socumentation of Pi in the Sky preoject will go.
For our project, we want to launch our raspberry pi into the sky using a stomp rocket. We are going to make the stomp rocket out of PVC pipes and 2 liter bottles. Then for our actual pi, we are going to be building a rocket.
